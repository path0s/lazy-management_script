> The script will contain a main folder named with the date on which the script will be executed (format date: yyyy-mm-dd) and will contain n folders how many are the formats of the only files inside the main folder and will transfer the corresponding files to the corresponding format folders <br>
Finally it generates a report file (called report.txt) that illustrates the information of the script and the listing of the newly created folders <br> <br>
The script helps to tidy up folders containing many files. Often we are lazy (lzy) and we don't want to tidy up our folders. Just think of the "Downloads" folder <br>
This script helps re-sort folders by organizing its interior in a better and clear way

## Usage
The script needs the path of directory as argument

Example on Linux:
```sh
./lzy.sh /home/linux/Desktop/Folder 
```

Example on Windows: <br>
Download [Git or Git Portable](https://git-scm.com/download/win) by the official website 
```sh
./lzy.sh C:\\Users\\path0s\\Desktop\\Folder 
```
