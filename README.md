> The script will consist of a main folder named with the date on which the script will be executed (date format: yyyy-mm-dd). It will contain n folders, corresponding to the formats of the only files inside the main folder, and it will transfer the corresponding files to their respective format folders. <br>
Finally, it will generate a report file called "report.txt" that provides information about the script and lists the newly created folders. <br> 
The script assists in organizing folders that contain numerous files. Often, we tend to be lazy and neglect organizing our folders, such as the "Downloads" folder. <br>
This script helps to reorganize folders by sorting their contents in a better and clearer manner.

## Usage
The script needs the path of directory as argument

Example on Linux:
```sh
./lzy.sh /home/linux/Desktop/Folder 
```

Example on Windows: <br>
Download [Git or Git Portable](https://git-scm.com/download/win) by the official website 
```sh
./lzy.sh C:\\Users\\path0s\\Desktop\\Folder 
```
