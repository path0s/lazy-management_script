<h5> WHY COULD IT BE USEFUL? </h5>
The script helps to tidy up folders containing many files. Often we are lazy (lzy) and we do not want to tidy up our folders. <br>
Just think about the "Download" folder in our pc: how many old and new files can it contain? how many useful files do we download in a day? <br>
This script helps re-sort folders by organizing its interior in a better and clear way <br>
